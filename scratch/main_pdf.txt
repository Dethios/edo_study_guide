1 Organization
1.1 Command Chains and Governance
Refs:

1.1.1 Operations Chain (Title 10)
Chain flow. President → Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) → Combatant Commander (CCDR). The Chairman of the Joint

Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) is the principal military adviser; service chiefs are not in the operational chain of Title 10.
Board cue. Boards love the contrast with acquisition authority; avoid conflating operational and acquisition chains.
Echelons. Counted from the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) (e.g., CNO is Echelon I, Systems Commands (SYSCOMs) are

Echelon II, etc.).
Figure 1.1 shows the Title 10 chain of command. Figure 1.2 shows the Chain of Command from the President to Echelon III
commands.

Figure 1.2. Organization Command Structure

1.1.2 Acquisition Governance (Department of the Navy)
Policy authority. Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) is the Service

Acquisition Executive (SAE) for the Department of the Navy (DON) and sets policy for Program Executive Offices (PEOs)
and Direct Reporting Program Managers (DRPMs) [SECNAV5400-15D, SECNAV5000-2G].
Matrix execution. PEOs hold program authority; SYSCOMs ( Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Naval Informa-

tion Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR), Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)) provide the Technical Authority
(TA) warrants and workforce; Naval Warfare Centers (NWCs) deliver research, development, test, and engineering support [SECNAV5400-15D].
Figure 1.3 shows the Navy acquisition governance chain of command.

Figure 1.4 contrasts the roles of TA and Program Authority (PA) in Navy acquisition.

1.2 Technical Authority and Engineering Agents
Refs:

1.2.1 What Technical Authority Is
TA. Independent engineering authority to set, maintain, and certify conformance to technical standards and baselines across

the lifecycle [SECNAV5400-15D].
Ultimate Technical Authority (UTA). Executed at the SYSCOM level (e.g., NAVSEA); resides with the Commander and flows

through the Chief Engineer via a formal warranting system [edo-2-1-5-technical-authority-2025].
Delegated TA. Warranted Technical Warrant Holders (TWHs) (Lead/Local/Warranted TA) receive domain-specific

authority across hull, mechanical, and electrical systems, combat systems, cybersecurity, and airworthiness or
seaworthiness [edo-2-1-5-technical-authority-2025].
Core TA duties. Must-know responsibilities:

1.2 Technical Authority and Engineering Agents

6

1. Establish and approve technical requirements, standards, and certification criteria;
2. Control the authoritative technical baseline (drawings, specs, interface control);
3. Adjudicate departures and waivers from specification and safety-critical changes; and
4. Certify readiness, readiness for service, and technical acceptability.
Independence. TA remains separate from cost, schedule, and programmatic authority to protect warfighter safety and mission

assurance [SECNAV5400-15D].
1.2.2 What EAs Do (and Do Not Do)

Engineering Agents (EAs) perform lifecycle engineering under TA governance. They are not TA unless they hold a TA warrant [edo-2-1-5-technical-authority-2025]. Common EA roles include:
In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA). Lifecycle systems engineering for fielded systems (e.g., fleet introduction, distance support,

troubleshooting/ Casualty Report (CASREP) support, maintenance planning, obsolescence, technical manuals/data, configuration of the in-service baseline).
Design Agent (DA). Develops detailed design and configuration documentation for a system or platform (e.g., ship detail de-

sign, Initial Capabilities Documents (ICDs), drawings, Technical Data Packages (TDPs)) to TA-approved standards.
Alteration Engineering Agent (AEA). Produces alteration packages (e.g., installation drawings, test procedures, logistics updates)

and supports fleet introduction for ship or system changes.
Systems Integration Agent (SIA). Orchestrates system-of-systems integration (e.g., interfaces, interoperability, cybersecurity in

the integration space) across combat system elements and platforms.
Technical Direction Agent (TDA). Issues and maintains technical work direction for installations and maintenance (e.g., Techni-

cal Work Document (TWD), local instructions) consistent with the TA-approved baseline.
1.2.3 Where Engineering Agent Authority Comes From
Statutory basis. [SECNAV5400-15D] assigns DON acquisition responsibilities, directing SYSCOMs to execute TA and to

designate Warfare Centers as EAs that support PEOs and Program Managers (PMs).
Delegations from TA. NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and NAVWAR Chief Engineers issue written warrants or designation

letters (Lead/Lab/Local TA) that flow requirements to specific Warfare Center codes; EA charters reference those
warrants [edo-2-1-5-technical-authority-2025].
Execution orders. PEOs and PMs provide technical direction letters, project orders, and statements of work that scope the

EA’s tasks while preserving independence for specification compliance and certification [edo-2-1-4-warfare-centers-2024].

1.3 NAVSEA Organization and Warfare Centers

7

Accountability. EAs report to the SYSCOM Chief Engineer for technical rigor and to the sponsoring PM for

cost and schedule; loss of a warrant or charter terminates their authority to issue technical documentation [edo-2-1-5-technical-authority-2025].
1.2.4 Waterfront Triage: What Engages Whom
Spec/drawing nonconformance (build or repair). Generate a departure or waiver request for the proper TA warrant holder;

minor deviations may be approved by Local or Lead TA, while major or safety-critical issues go to the Chief Engineer/ UTA.
In-service failure ( CASREP/technical assist). ISEA opens a support case, provides immediate workarounds and troubleshooting,

coordinates root-cause analysis, updates technical data, and recommends permanent fixes (engineering change or alteration).
Change to configuration. If a permanent change is needed, the AEA develops the alteration package; SIA validates interfaces;

DA updates drawings and TDPs; TA approves and certifies.
Principle to remember. EAs execute engineering; TA sets the rules and certifies compliance.

collaboration environment).
Program Executive Office, Manpower, Logistics and Business IT (PEO MLB). Modernizes manpower, logistics, and business

information-technology systems.
1.6.1 PEO/Warfare Center Interaction Model
Role Designation. PEOs charter Warfare Centers as EAs ( ISEA, DA, SIA) via technical direction letters aligned with

[SECNAV5400-15D]; the Warfare Center executes under Navy Working Capital Fund (NWCF) funding while reporting
performance to the PM [edo-2-1-4-warfare-centers-2024].
Requirements Translation. PM Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) decompose Capabilities Development Documents (CDDs)

into technical requirements that Warfare Center TA holders validate and flow down through alteration packages, interface
control documents, and test plans [edo-2-1-4-warfare-centers-2024].
Funding Mechanisms. PEO PMOs issue project orders or Economy Act orders using their appropriations; Warfare Centers

accept into NWCF, schedule Work Breakdown Structures (WBSs), and recover rates through Stabilized Labor Rates (SLRs)
while keeping the PM apprised of burn rates and Net Operating Result (NOR) impacts [edo-3-1-5-field-activity-fm-2025].
Governance Rhythm. Monthly technical reviews focus on requirements churn, test results, and configuration control; quarterly

business reviews reconcile execution to SLR assumptions and assess workforce mix, drawing on Warfare Center cost visibility [SECNAV5400-15D, edo-3-1-5-field-activity-fm-2025].
Acquisition Decision Events. Warfare Centers provide independent readiness assessments (test status, technical risk)

for PEO milestone decisions, often serving as certifying authorities for safety releases or flight clearances prior to
fielding [SECNAV5400-15D, edo-2-1-4-warfare-centers-2024].

2 PPBE
2.1 PPBE (Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution)
Refs:

2.1.1 What PPBE does

Aligns strategy to resources across the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). Planning (strategy → guidance), Programming
(balanced force/program → Program Objective Memorandum (POM)), Budgeting (validated request → President’s Budget
(PB)), Execution (obligations/outlays → performance feedback) [edo-3-1-1-ppbe-2025].
2.1.2 Timeline (annual rhythm)

Figure 2.1 shows the Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution (PPBE) timeline across multiple fiscal years with key
milestones during each calendar year.

2.1.6 PPBE Programming
3-Star v.s. 4-Star Reviews:

During Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)’s Program Review, issues raised on the Services’

POMs move first to a 3-Star Programmers Panel (staff-level, chaired by Director, CAPE (DCAPE)) that vets issue papers,
builds options (with offsets), and forwards recommendations. Unresolved or strategy-level trades go to the 4-Star forum, the
Deputy’s Management Action Group (DMAG) co-led by the Deputy SECDEF (with the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff (VCJCS)), for senior adjudication. Decisions at this stage are documented as a PDM or (in recent cycles) a programmatic
Resource Management Decision (RMD), which updates the FYDP and hands off to the Comptroller’s Budget Review that
culminates in budgetary RMDs.
2.1.7 Appropriations Life-cycle (Colors of Money)

Figure 2.3 visualizes when each major appropriation category is Current, Expired, or Cancelled. Pair this with the obligation
windows discussion so you can sketch the chart quickly at the board.

2.1.8 IGT (Intragovernmental Transactions)
Definition. Orders and collections between federal entities using Treasury’s G-Invoicing: 7600A (order), 7600B (agreemen-

t/performance), Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC) for collections [Treasury-GInvoicing].
Why it matters. Intragovernmental Transaction (IGT) acceptance is an obligation on the customer side and the revenue recogni-

tion driver for the performing Working Capital Fund (WCF) activity.
2.1.9 Common Ordering Instruments
Work Order. Internal directive used within a command to control scope/cost/schedule.
Project Order. Statutory order for a definite, specific, and entire project; obligational on acceptance; performs like a contract

between Department of Defense (DoD) activities. (41 U.S.C. § 6307) [USC-6307-ProjectOrder]
Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)/IPR (DD Form 448). Economy Act order between federal entities;

obligational when accepted; performed by the servicing agency. (31 U.S.C. § 1535) [USC-1535-EconomyAct,
Treasury-GInvoicing]

2.1.10 Fiscal Law (Know These Cold)

Purpose Statute (“Misappropriation”). Funds must be used only for their appropriated purpose (31 U.S.C. § 1301(a)) [USC-1301-Purpos

Bona Fide Needs Rule. Use current-year appropriations only for legitimate needs of that fiscal year (31 U.S.C. § 1502(a)) [USC-1502-BFN
Anti-Deficiency Act. Do not obligate/expend in excess of available amounts or before funds are available (31 U.S.C. § 1341,

§ 1517) [USC-1341-ADA].

2.2 NWCF Essentials: Rates, Results, and Execution

21

2.1.11 Reprogramming: Moving Resources After Enactment
Four mechanisms (high level).

1. Congressional Prior Approval Reprogramming (PA Reprog): Actions above statutory/committee thresholds or affecting
congressional special-interest items or new starts. Requires approval from all four defense committees; timing driven by
committee cycles [DoDFMR-Vol3].
2. Internal Reprogramming (IR): Realignments within an appropriation that do not cross thresholds or trigger congressional
interest; used for proper purpose alignment without changing totals. Notice sent to committees [DoDFMR-Vol3].
3. Below-Threshold Reprogramming (BTR): Component-level authority to move funds below set dollar/percent
limits within the same appropriation/fiscal year; limits reset annually by appropriations acts/committee guidance [DoDFMR-Vol3].
4. Letter Transfer (LT): Treasury non-expenditure transfer moving budgetary resources between appropriations/treasury
symbols when authorized (e.g., statute or enacted language) [DoDFMR-Vol3].
Hint

General rules of thumb—cannot change color-of-money or extend time; must complete before funds’ obligation period ends;

expired-year accounts limited to valid upward/downward adjustments only [DoDFMR-Vol3].

2.1.12 From Enactment to Field Authority

1. Treasury warrants the appropriation; Office of Management and Budget (OMB) apportions on Standard Form 132.
2. OSD (Comptroller) issues allocations to components such as the DON.
3. OPNAV ( Financial Management Budget (OPNAV) (FMB)/ OPNAV Programming Division (N82)) allocates to SYSCOM
BSOs (Echelon II), which suballocate to Warfare Centers (Echelon III), followed by allowances/allotments to the Enterprise
Resource Planning (ERP) system [DoDFMR-Vol3].
4. Commands record commitments, obligations, and expenses, and request outlays via Defense Finance and Accounting
Service (DFAS).

2.2.1 Key Definitions (Execution)
Commitment. Administrative reservation of funds in anticipation of an obligation; reduces available authority but is not yet a

legal liability [DoDFMR-Vol3] (e.g., National Reconnaissance Office (NRO)’s Request for Contract Action (RCA) process).
Obligation. Legal liability incurred that encumbers funds [DoDFMR-Vol3] (e.g., award of a contract, acceptance of an IGT

order).
Expenditure/Expense. Recording of cost when goods/services are received/accepted (accrual basis) [DoDFMR-Vol3] (e.g.,

sending check to pay an invoice).
Outlay/Disbursement. Treasury cash payment to a vendor or performing activity [DoDFMR-Vol3] (e.g., payment check is

cashed in).
2.2.2 Flow: PMO Purchase Request to Treasury Payment

1. PMO commits funds (approved in the ERP system).
2. Contract award or IGT order acceptance creates the obligation [DoDFMR-Vol3, Treasury-GInvoicing].
3. Performance/acceptance posts expense (accrual).
4. DFAS schedules the invoice for payment; Treasury disburses (outlay) via IPAC (for IGT) or commercial
EFT [Treasury-GInvoicing].
2.2.3 NWCF Metrics and Equations
NOR (annual profit/loss).

NOR = Revenue − Total Expenses
Target performance remains near break-even over time (small NOR) [DoDFMR-Vol3].
Accumulated Operating Result (AOR) (retained earnings/equity over time).

AOR𝑡 = AOR𝑡−1 + NOR𝑡 ± Other Adjustments
Represents the corpus (net position) of the fund [DoDFMR-Vol3].
2.2.4 NWCF Corpus v.s. Appropriations
Corpus ( AOR/Working Capital). Revolving cash and retained earnings authorized under 10 U.S.C. § 2208 [USC-2208-NWCF];

remains available without fiscal year limitation to finance operations until recovered through stabilized
rates [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].

2.2 NWCF Essentials: Rates, Results, and Execution

23

Customer Appropriations. Mission-funded (e.g., Operation and Maintenance, Navy (OMN), Research, Development, Test, and

Evaluation (RDT&E), Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN)) dollars obligated by the customer when a project order or
inter/intra-governmental order is accepted; purpose, time, and amount statutes still apply to the customer [DoDFMR-Vol3].
Capital Investment Program (CIP). Financed by NWCF corpus but budgeted in the capital budget exhibit; used for plant/equip-

ment modernization and amortized back through rates, not through a separate appropriation [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
No Augmentation. NWCF activities cannot augment customer appropriations; corpus only bridges cash timing between ex-

pense recognition and reimbursement [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
2.2.5 Stabilized Rates and SLR
Stabilized Rates. Customer prices set in the budget build to recover expected full costs (labor, material, overhead, deprecia-

tion/C CIP) with a near-zero NOR goal [DoDFMR-Vol3].
SLR. Published labor $/hr for a shop/code; recovers direct labor + fringe + overhead + G&A + capital depreciation recov-

ery [DoDFMR-Vol3]:
SLR =

Direct Labor + Fringe + OH + G&A + Depreciation Recovery
Direct Labor Hours

Adjustment Battle Rhythm. Rates are established two years ahead during the PPBE budget build and held constant

throughout budget year execution; mid-year changes require OUSD(C) approval when earned rates diverge materially
from planned costs, and Navy BSOs typically review SLR accuracy monthly/quarterly to recommend any out-of-cycle
adjustments [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
2.2.6 NWCF v.s. Mission-Funded (Appropriation) Commands
Which billets at NWCF are mission-funded.

Military administration and leadership billets (CO/XO/Admin) are funded by Mili-

tary Personnel (MILPERS) and treated as mission-funded within NWCF; certain command/HQ oversight billets may also be

OMN funded by policy, so verify locally. These costs are not recovered in stabilized rates. Others that are assigned to NWCF will
bill hours towards work and the NWCF will reimburse MILPERS [DoDFMR-Vol3].
2.2.7 Standing Up or Modifying a NWCF Business Area

1. Business Case Development: Sponsor (e.g., ASN(RD&A) or SYSCOM) prepares analytical justification showing workload,
demand signal, and ability to operate on a revolving basis without violating purpose/time/amount [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
2. acdon Approval Chain: Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) (delegated to ASN (FM&C)) endorses the concept and forwards
to OUSD(C) while coordinating with Navy Comptroller to align PPBE exhibits [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
3. OUSD(C)/ OMB Review: DoD Chief Financial Officer (CFO) validates cash requirements, rate methodology, and capital
plan, then seeks OMB alignment for the PB [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].

2.2 NWCF Essentials: Rates, Results, and Execution

24

4. Congressional Notification: Congress must be notified (and, when required, explicitly authorize in appropriations or
authorizations) before execution; 10 U.S.C. § 2208 [USC-2208-NWCF] restricts creation of new WCFs without legislative
awareness [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
5. Implementation: Once approved, the new business area is issued an NWCF business unit code, begins PPBE rate build
two years out, and transitions legacy appropriated accounts via opening balance adjustments [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
2.2.8 NWCF Cycle of Operations (Order to Cash)

1. Customer order. IGT 7600A or project order is received and accepted, creating the customer’s obligation.
2. Work in process. Labor and material are applied; costs accumulate; billing events are scheduled per percent complete or
delivery.
3. Revenue recognition and billing. The NWCF recognizes revenue and bills via IPAC ( IGT) or a commercial invoice if
authorized.
4. Collection (cash). Treasury IPAC/electronic funds transfer posts; NWCF cash increases; NOR/ AOR update through the
period close [DoDFMR-Vol3, Treasury-GInvoicing].
2.2.9 Operating During a Continuing Resolution
Customer Funding Limits. Appropriated customers remain bound by prior-year obligation rates and anti-deficiency constraints;

NWCF orders cannot exceed apportioned CR amounts until an appropriations act is passed [CRS-CR].
Cash Cushion. Existing NWCF corpus allows Warfare Centers to keep executing accepted orders (labor continues,

suppliers paid) even if reimbursements lag, provided cash balances stay within the FMR’s upper/lower operating
limits [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
No New Starts. CR guidance prohibits new start projects, major capital investments, or rate changes absent explicit exception;

NWCF managers defer new workloads that would obligate customer funds beyond CR allowances [CRS-CR].
Rate Discipline. Stabilized rates remain frozen; only emergency OUSD(C)-approved rate adjustments may occur, so BSOs focus

on expense control to avoid large NOR swings during the CR period [DoDFMR-Vol3-Ch19].
2.2.10 Why Use a Warfare Center (Organic)
Things PMOs/industry can’t do. Inherently governmental TA warrants, certification authority, certain safety releases; highly

classified or nuclear workspaces.
Things they shouldn’t do. Independent test/assessment, spec adjudication, tech baseline control, blue-&-gold separation to

avoid Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI).
Things they won’t do. Sustainment engineering at scale, depot-level organic repair, fleet distance support.

2.4.3 Funding policies
Annual. ( OMN/ MILPERS). Fund only bona fide needs of the fiscal year.
Incremental. ( RDT&E). Fund work as it occurs by fiscal year.
Full-funding. (Procurement/ MILCON). Fund the total usable end-item at award.1

Common techniques/exceptions: Advance Procurement (long-lead items), Multiyear Procurement, Economic Order Quantity, Cost-

to-Complete when provided in law.
Exceptions to the Full Funding Policy

Below is the list of the key exceptions to the Full Funding Policy, what they allow, and the must-know rules/approvals (Table VIII
shows full details).

Quick information regarding exceptions to the full funding policy:
MYP. Up to 5 years; stable design; verifiable savings; cancellation liability planned.
Advance Procurement ( Long-Lead Time Material (LLTM)/ EOQ). Focused early buys for schedule/savings; not full funding.
Block Buy (BB). Congressionally authorized multi-ship buys; obligate by Fiscal Year (FY); not the MYP statute.
Cost-to-Complete (CTC). Complete original scope when estimates mature upward; separate SCN request.

Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH). Planned mid-life overhaul; incremental SCN with advance procurement of cores/criti-

cal material.
2.4.4 Which money when (by acquisition phase)

Table IX shows the nominal types of appropriation used for Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA), Technology Maturation and
Risk Reduction (TMRR), Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Production and Deployment Phase (P&D), and
Operations and Support Phase (O&S)
Table IX: Appropriation types per phase

Phase

Typical appropriation(s)

MSA

RDT&E (analyses, prototyping); small OMN for studies

TMRR

RDT&E (risk reduction, development, test)

EMD

RDT&E (develop/build/test/qualify); selected long-lead/AP/EOQ in Procurement when authorized

PD

Procurement (e.g., OPN); limited RDT&E for fixes

OS

OMN sustainment; spares via Procurement as applicable

2.4.5 MILCON v.s. O&M sustainment v.s. OPN modernization

Rule of thumb: Real property construction ⇒ MILCON; keeping systems running (repair/overhaul, services) ⇒ OMN; new

capability/end-item upgrades ⇒ Procurement (e.g., Other Procurement, Navy (OPN)).
2.4.6 Field Activity Financial Management (NWCF quick hits)
Goal. NWCF activities price to break even over time; in-year result is NOR, cumulative is AOR.
Rates ( SLR). Recover direct labor + overhead + G&A; shocks flow to NOR/AOR and are managed over time.
Carryover. Unfilled orders at FY end; subject to limits/management.
IGT via G-Invoicing. Treasury-mandated platform for intra-gov orders/settlement; apportionment/availability rules still govern

customer funds.

2.5 Cost Elements, Estimates, and Learning Curves
Refs:

2.5 Cost Elements, Estimates, and Learning Curves

31

2.5.1 Direct v.s. Indirect Costs
Direct. Traceable to a final cost objective (e.g., technician hours, end-item material).
Indirect. Pooled and allocated (overhead, G&A, facilities, depreciation). See the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) cost

principles [FAR].
2.5.2 Program Cost Terms (Know the Stack)
Flyaway Cost. Recurring production cost of an aircraft/weapon delivered (excludes non-recurring tooling, spares, support).
Weapon System Cost. Flyaway plus support equipment, training, data, and initial spares.
Procurement Cost. Weapon system cost plus peculiar support and MILCON as applicable.
Life-Cycle Cost (LCC). All costs from concept through disposal ( RDT&E, procurement, O&S, disposal).
Total Ownership Cost (TOC). LCC plus broader infrastructure/indirect enterprise costs.
Note

Use DON/ DoD cost handbook definitions; be consistent across documents. [SECNAV5000-2G, DoDI5000-85].
Figure 2.5 shows the LCC from above and how they relate to one another. Note how each cost builds to the next as different
types of expenditures are added.

2.5.3 Why the LCCE Matters

Establishes the affordability baseline, informs Acquisition Program Baseline (APB), drives color-of-money phasing, and underpins
“will-cost / should-cost” targets [DoDI5000-85]. Figure 2.6 shows the different types of funding that will be used in different
phases of the Major Capability Acquisition (MCA). Most of the LCC will be from the O&S phase.

2.5.4 Estimating Methods (When to Use)
Analogy. Early stages; limited data; similar system scaling.
Parametric. Cost Estimating Relationships (CERs) (e.g., weight, Source Lines of Codes (SLOCs)); Analysis of Alternatives

(AoA)/ TMRR; fast trade-space.
Engineering (Bottom-up). Detailed design/ Bill of Materials (BoMs); EMD/production maturity; schedule-critical Integrated

Baseline Reviews (IBRs).
Actuals/Extrapolation. Learning/production maturity; later lots [DAU-AAF].

2.5.5 Products and Players
Cost Analysis Requirements Description (CARD). Technical/schedule baseline for independent estimates.
Independent Cost Estimate (ICE). Component Acquisition Executive (CAE) or OSD CAPE for Acquisition Category (ACAT) I;

Program Office Estimate (POE).

2.5 Cost Elements, Estimates, and Learning Curves

33

Cost and Software Data (CSDR). Contractor cost & software data reporting for actuals/ CERs.
APB/ Selected Acquisition Report (SAR)/ Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES). Baselines and report-

ing [DoDI5000-85].
2.5.6 Learning Curve (Production Efficiency)

If unit time/cost follows an 𝑠% slope, doubling quantity reduces unit cost by 𝑠%. Typical aerospace slopes: 85–90% early, flattening as processes mature. Plan lots and spares buys accordingly [DAU-AAF].
2.5.7 Cost Escalation (Inflation Indices)

Escalate base-year costs to then-year using approved DoD inflation indices; separate real growth from price growth; align phasing to obligation windows [DoDFMR-Vol3].
2.5.8 Will-Cost / Should-Cost
Will-Cost. Conservative reference estimate used for budgeting and margin planning.
Should-Cost. Management targets that drive efficiencies (e.g., lean events, value engineering, rate negotia-

tions) [DoDI5000-85].

3 Contracting and Solicitation
3.1 Intro to Contracting Fundamentals
Refs:

3.1.1 Why the Navy Uses Contracts

• Contracts create a legally enforceable relationship between the Government and industry partners, defining rights and
responsibilities for each party.

• Written terms provide structure for changes via agreed conditions, protecting both the Navy and the Contractor throughout
acquisition actions.

• Binding agreements ensure accountability for cost, schedule, and performance outcomes that cannot be achieved through
informal arrangements.
3.1.2 Essential Elements of a Binding Contract
Mutual Assent. Requires an offer and acceptance with a meeting of the minds on all material terms such as scope, price, quan-

tity, and delivery.
Consideration. Both sides exchange value (e.g., payment, performance, schedule relief) that courts will evaluate for adequacy

in Government contracting.
Capacity. Parties must be legally competent to enter the agreement; lack of capacity (e.g., incapacity, lack of authority) under-

mines enforceability.
Lawful Purpose. The contract must pursue a legal objective; agreements for unlawful acts are void.

3.1.3 Government Relationship to Contractors
Transactional. Each party enters with distinct incentives (contractor profit versus government outcomes); avoid unauthorized

commitments.
Professional. Both teams must understand the contract and collaborate to meet requirements.

3.1 Intro to Contracting Fundamentals

35

Collaborative. Contractors bring technical expertise while programmatic decision-making remains inherently governmental.
Constrained. Interactions are bound by ethics rules, conflicts-of-interest standards, and contract clauses.

3.1.4 FAR System and NAVSEA Overlays
FAR. Government-wide acquisition regulation establishing policy, procedures, and contract clauses [FAR].
DFARS. DoD-level supplement tailoring FAR provisions for defense-unique requirements, including competition, source selec-

tion, and industrial base policy [DFARS].
NMCARS. Department of the Navy supplement that adds Navy-specific directives such as approval thresholds, peer reviews, and

templates [NMCARS].
SOM Chapter 3. NAVSEA guidance for Supervisors of Shipbuilding on contract formation, modification, and surveil-

lance [SOM-Ch3-2023].
NAVSEA Source Selection Guide. Standardizes competitive source selection procedures, roles, and documentation for Sea Sys-

tems Command procurements [NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].
NAVSEA Contracts Handbook. Practical desk reference covering policy interpretations, clause usage, and best practices for

NAVSEA contracting professionals [NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].
3.1.5 Types of Contracting Officers (Know All Three)
Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Leads acquisition planning through award; signs contracts and bilateral modifications on

behalf of the Government.
Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO). Oversees post-award administration, surveillance, and contractor performance; typi-

cally assigned via Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) or NAVSEA field offices.
Termination Contracting Officer (TCO). Manages partial or complete contract terminations, settlement proposals, and equitable

adjustments.
All contracting officers must hold a warrant that delineates dollar and authority limits; only a warranted Contracting Officer
(KO) can obligate the United States [FAR].
3.1.6 PM and KO Partnership
PM. Accountable to the Milestone Decision Authority for cost, schedule, and performance; integrates technical authority,

requirements, and budget execution across the lifecycle.
KO. Provides acquisition strategy execution expertise, ensures compliance with statute/regulation, and is responsible for

contract integrity and enforceability.

3.1 Intro to Contracting Fundamentals

36

Board Cue. PMs lead program outcomes; KOs safeguard the contracting instrument. Neither can assume the other’s authori-

ties, so coordination before solicitations, negotiations, or modifications is mandatory.
3.1.7 Competition in Contracting Act Requirements
Full and Open Competition. Default posture: all responsible sources may compete [USC-3201-CICA, FAR].
Full and Open After Exclusion of Sources. Permits set-asides (e.g., small business, 8(a)) or alternate-source strategies when justi-

fied [FAR].
Approval for Other than Full and Open. Requires documented justification and senior approval per Subpart 6.3 [FAR].
Seven Exceptions to Full and Open Competition (Memorize)

1. Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements (see [FAR]).
2. Unusual and compelling urgency (see [FAR]).
3. Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability (see [FAR]).
4. International agreement (see [FAR]).
5. Authorized or required by statute (see [FAR]).
6. National security (see [FAR]).
7. Public interest (see [FAR]).
Hint

Be ready to cite an example scenario for each exception and the approval level required.

3.1.8 Responsiveness, Responsibility, and Key Determinations
Responsiveness (sealed bidding). Bid must conform to all material terms of the Invitation for Bids; nonconforming bids are

rejected without discussion [FAR].
Responsibility. Prospective contractor must possess adequate resources, schedule compliance, performance record, integrity,

and necessary systems to receive award ([FAR]).
3.1.9 Justification and Approval (J&A) v.s. Determination and Findings (D&F)
J&A. Documents the rationale for other-than-full-and-open competition, identifies the chosen statutory exception, and records

approval by the appropriate official. Must be posted to https://sam.gov after award with required redactions [FAR].

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

37

D&F. Formal determination that specific conditions are satisfied before taking an action (e.g., use of special contract types,

multiyear contracting); states the findings that support the determination [FAR].
Note

At the NRO, documents and rational are post on the low and high-side Acquisition Research Center (ARC). We are
required to post other-full-and-0pen compeition for five days on the ARC to allow opportuniy for other contracters to bid.

3.1.10 Who Signs D&Fs (and When)
General Rule. [FAR] requires the contracting officer to sign D&Fs when the action is within their delegated authority, unless a

higher approval level is specified elsewhere in the regulation or delegation memo.
Head Contracting Activity (HCA). [FAR] reserve approval for actions such as issuing a letter contract or awarding a single-award

task/delivery Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) expected to exceed $100M; DON HCAs may redelegate no
lower than a flag/Senior Executive [NMCARS].
SAE. Multiyear contracting, extraordinary contractual relief, or other actions identified in [FAR] and [DFARS] require a D&F

signed by the Service SAE ( ASN(RD&A) for the Navy, who is also the DON Senior Procurement Executive) or a specifically
delegated official.
Document Content. Every D&F must cite the specific statutory/regulatory authority, describe supporting facts, and state the

determination in clear language; expiration dates and any required follow-on reviews must also be included per [FAR] and
[NMCARS] guidance.

3.2 Solicitation Preparation
Refs:

3.2.1 Summary
Uniform Contract Format (UCF) scaffolding. Tailor the Uniform Contract Format (Sections A through M) so Section C defines

the requirement, Section L tells offerors how to respond, and Section M mirrors evaluation factors and the stated basis of
award [FAR, edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].
Release readiness. Do not release the Request for Proposal (RFP) until the acquisition plan/strategy is approved, funds are

certified, legal review is complete, synopsis rules are satisfied, and the source-selection teams are chartered [FAR, NMCARS,
edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

38

Communication discipline. Request for Informations (RFIs), draft RFPs, industry days, and Q&A all flow through the KO;

once released, clarifications must be shared with all offerors through written amendments or controlled exchanges [FAR,
edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].

3.2.2 Practitioner Steps

1. Finalize the requirement package (spec/ Statement of Work (SOW), Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs), Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE), market research report) with IPT concurrence and Small Business coordination
documentation [FAR, edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].
2. Structure Section L instructions: volumes, page limits, submission medium, proposal due date, classification controls, and
[FAR] synopsis timing.
3. Align Section M evaluation factors, subfactors, and relative importance statements with the basis of award ( Lowest Price
Technically Acceptable (LPTA) v.s.
trade-off) and rating methodology approved by the Source Selection Authority (SSA), KO, legal, and cost/price community [FAR, NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].
4. Verify pre-release approvals and postings: acquisition plan or strategy, Determination of Acquisition Strategy (as applicable),
certified funds, and SAM.gov synopsis [NMCARS, edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].
5. Manage amendments and records after release: capture bidder Q&A, issue conformed RFPs, adjust milestones when requirements shift, and file every action in the official contract record [FAR, NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].
3.2.3 Checklist

• Acquisition plan/strategy signed; conformed requirements package appended [NMCARS].
• Funding document ( Purchase Request (PR), project order, or MIPR) signed and funds certified for the planned obligation [FAR].

• Market research report and Small Business Coordination Record approved [FAR].
• Source Selection Plan endorsed by SSA, legal, and cost/price; nondisclosure/ OCI statements executed
for SSA, Source Selection Advisory Council (SSAC), Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), and advisors [NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].

• Section L instructions mirror Section M factors, include proposal structure, late proposal policy, and submission portal
guidance [FAR].

• SAM.gov synopsis posted (15 days before closing for most supplies/services; 30 days for R&D unless justified) [FAR].

• Amendment template/change log prepared; routing matrix established for expedited approvals [NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-202

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

3.2.4 Navy Overlays and Tailoring
NMCARS overlays. Follow 5205.303/5205.301 for synopsis exceptions and NAVSEA contracting notices for Contract Require-

ment Package checklists and release approvals [NMCARS, NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].
Technical data. Coordinate with TA on DFARS § 252.227 clauses, distribution statements, and CDRL tailoring to protect Navy

equities [DFARS].
Shipbuilding tailoring. For availabilities, modernization, or planning efforts, ensure Section C and the WBS

matches the avail sequence and integrates warfare-center technical direction and installation responsibilities [edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].
3.2.5 Industry Engagement & Communications
Pre-release. RFIs, sources-sought notices, draft RFPs, and industry days are vetted through the KO; responses shared with all

potential offerors to avoid unequal access [FAR].
Post-release. Clarifications and Q&A must be issued as amendments for all offerors; exchanges stay within [FAR] boundaries

until competitive range is established [NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].
Small business focus. Coordinate with the Small Business Professional and Competition Advocate on set-aside decisions, sub-

contracting plan reviews, and mitigation of potential limitations on subcontracting [FAR].
3.2.6 Documentation & Approvals to Capture

• Signed Source Selection Plan and SSA/ SSAC/ SSEB appointment letters with confidentiality and OCI certifications [NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].

• Competition Advocate memoranda where narrowed sources or synopsis deviations are requested [FAR, NMCARS].
• Legal sufficiency memorandum for the conformed solicitation (Sections C, H, L, and M) retained in the contract
file [NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].

• KO release memorandum noting solicitation number, issue date, amendment log, and proposal due date/time [edo-3-2-2-solicitation-prep-2025].
3.2.7 Competitive Method Selection: Sealed Bidding v.s. Negotiated Procurement
Sealed bidding (FAR Part 14). Preferred when requirements are well-defined, award will be based on price alone, discussions

are not needed, and the Government expects to receive more than one responsive bid. It uses public opening, responsiveness
determinations, and fixed-price awards [FAR].
Negotiated procurement (FAR Part 15). Used when the Government needs to evaluate technical approach or past performance,

intends to conduct discussions, or when requirements or pricing demand flexibility. Negotiated acquisitions support bestvalue trade-offs and cost-reimbursement vehicles [FAR].

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

40

When to choose. If the team can describe performance in terms of precise specifications with minimal risk and expects

no need for exchanges, sealed bidding streamlines award. When innovation, risk, or integration complexity requires
subjective evaluation, or when schedule/budget changes are likely, negotiated procurement is mandatory [FAR,
NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].

3.2.8 Contract Type Landscape and Risk Allocation
Fixed-price family. Contractor accepts the cost risk; Government locks price once requirements are stable. Includes:

• Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP): Used for mature, low-risk requirements, often in Production and Deployment [FAR,
DoDI5000-85].

• Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) (FPIF): Shares cost variance through a negotiated share ratio; encourages cost
control while keeping final price bounded by a ceiling. Used during Engineering & Manufacturing Development ( EMD)
or Low-Rate Initial Production (LRIP) when cost risk remains but production discipline is needed [FAR, DoDI5000-85].

• Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA): Adds indexed adjustments for volatile commodities or longlead items [FAR].

• Fixed-Price Redetermination (FPR): Re-prices after defined milestones when initial uncertainty is expected to retire [FAR].
Cost-reimbursement family. Government carries more cost risk; contractor must deliver best effort. Includes:

• Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF): Used in early R&D or prototyping ( MSA/ TMRR) when effort is exploratory [FAR,
DoDI5000-85].

• Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF): Shares cost variance similar to FPIF but without a price ceiling; encourages efficiency
while acknowledging uncertain cost baseline [FAR].

• Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF): Adds subjective award-fee evaluation for mission effectiveness or management performance that cannot be captured in objective metrics [FAR].

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

41

Figure 3.1. Cost-reimbursement contract risk/fee characteristics.

Award v.s. incentive fees. Incentive fees (cost or performance) are calculated from predetermined formulas tied to measurable

outcomes (cost, schedule, technical). Award fees are earned through periodic board evaluations against tailored factors and
may be unearned if performance is merely satisfactory [FAR, NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023].
Award-fee governance. The Award Fee Determining Official (often the PM or SSA designee) chairs an Award Fee Board, uses

the approved plan, and issues a determination memo. Fees are paid after each period and must be commensurate with value
delivered; scores below the threshold earn zero dollars for that segment [FAR, NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].
MCA phase alignment. MSA and TMRR generally use CPFF or CPAF because of design uncertainty; EMD can transition to

CPIF or FPIF as risk retires; Production and Deployment favors FFP/ FPIF; Operations and Support relies on FFP or FFP
Level of Effort (LOE) and can incorporate sustainment IDIQs for depot work [DoDI5000-85].
MSA. Analytical trades and early prototypes benefit from CPFF flexibility as requirement scope evolves.
TMRR. CPIF/ CPAF maintain incentives while the Government still absorbs major technical risk during competitive prototyp-

ing.
EMD. FPIF or CPIF balance contractor motivation and cost control once the design stabilizes, with ceilings to protect the

Government.

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

42

PD. FFP/ FPIF dominate because production baselines and learning curves are known; contractor should own execution

risk.
OS. Sustainment leverages FFP, FFP LOE, or IDIQs task orders to manage repeatable workloads and retain competition for

modernization.

Figure 3.2. Contract-type emphasis across MCA phases.

3.2.9 Fixed-Price Incentive (Firm Target) Mechanics
Share ratio. Defines how cost overruns or underruns are split between Government and contractor (e.g., 70/30 means Govern-

ment absorbs 70
Point of total assumption ( Point of Total Assumption (PTA)). The cost point beyond which every additional dollar of overrun is

borne entirely by the contractor:

𝑃𝑇𝐴 =

Ceiling Price − Target Cost
Government Share Ratio

+ Target Cost.

Example. Target cost $100M, target profit $10M (target price $110M), ceiling price $120M, share ratio 70/30. If actual cost is

$112M:
Contract price = $110M + 0.3 × ($100M − $112M) = $106.4M.

The PTA occurs at $113.3 M; beyond that, profit erodes dollar-for-dollar until exhausted [FAR, NAVSEA-Contracts-Handbook-2023]

3.2 Solicitation Preparation

Figure 3.3. Fixed-price incentive geometry (cost, profit, PTA).

3.2.10 Indefinite & Flexible Contract Forms
IDIQ. Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity contracts provide flexibility in quantity and timing with task/delivery orders;

suited for recurring installations, sustainment, or services [FAR].
Time-and-Materials (T&M)/ Labor-Hour (LH). Hybrid vehicles when it is not possible to estimate effort precisely; require ceiling

price, surveillance, and justification because Government assumes cost risk on labor hours [FAR].
Undefinitized contract actions ( Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs)). Letter contracts or other actions authorized before all

terms are settled (e.g., urgent ship repair). Must be definitized within the regulatory timeline, with strict management for
obligation limits and profit [FAR, DFARS, NMCARS].
3.2.11 Simplified Acquisition and Small Business Programs
Simplified Acquisition Threshold ( Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT)). Generally $250,000 (higher in contingency or overseas

circumstances). Benefits include streamlined competition, quotation-based awards, and mandatory small-business reservations above the micro-purchase threshold [FAR].
Small Business Administration ( Small Business Administration (SBA)) programs. FAR Part 19 [FAR] implements 8(a), Historically

Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Women-Owned
Small Business (WOSB) programs. The contracting officer must consider set-asides, sole-source thresholds, and subcontracting plans to meet DON goals.

3.3 Cost and Price Evaluation

44

3.2.12 Alternative Acquisition Authorities
Other Transaction ( Other Transaction (OT)) agreements. Authorized by 10 U.S.C. § 4021 (prototype) and § 4022 (follow-on

production) to rapidly engage nontraditional performers, provided cost share or significant participation criteria are
met [USC-4021-OTA, USC-4022-OTF].
Small Business Innovation Research ( Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)). 15 U.S.C. § 638 establishes Phase I (feasibility),

Phase II (prototype), and Phase III (commercialization/production). SBIR awards leverage R&D funds to deliver Navy-unique
technology with data rights protections for five years [USC-638-SBIR].
3.2.13 Technical Data Rights Overview
Unlimited rights. Government may use, disclose, and authorize others without restriction (typically for data developed exclu-

sively at Government expense) [DFARS].
Government purpose rights. Government may use or authorize contractors for Government purposes for five years, after which

rights convert to unlimited. Applies to mixed-funding developments [DFARS].
Limited/Restricted rights. Contractor retains control; Government use is constrained to internal purposes (limited for noncom-

mercial technical data, restricted for commercial computer software). Negotiated licenses or specifically negotiated licenses
can expand access [DFARS].
3.2.14 Uniform Contract Format Essentials
Sections A through H (contract). Cover Standard Form 33, supplies/services, packaging, inspection, delivery, special contract

requirements, clauses, and attachments [FAR].
Sections I through K (legal/representations). Incorporate FAR/DFARS clauses, representations, certifications, and instructions

for completion [FAR, DFARS].
Sections L and M (solicitation/Evaluation). Instructions to offerors, proposal structure, page limits, and evaluation

criteria that must remain synchronized to any change to factors or relative order requires an amendment [FAR,
NAVSEA-Source-Selection-Guide-2022].

3.3 Cost and Price Evaluation
Refs:

3.3.1 Summary
KO accountability. The KO must determine that every negotiated price is fair and reasonable, integrating price, cost, technical,

field-pricing, and risk analysis inputs before award per FAR 15.404-1(a)(1)–(5) [FAR].

3.3 Cost and Price Evaluation

45

Cost v.s. price lens. Use price analysis when certified cost or pricing data are not required, and escalate to cost analysis when

element-by-element scrutiny is needed to support the prenegotiation objective [FAR].
Rate discipline. Forward pricing rates and structured profit analysis keep the Government prenegotiation objective current; the

objective is always proposed cost plus profit or fee per FAR policy [FAR].
Financial health cue. Profitability ratios ( Return on Sales (ROS), Return on Assets (ROA)) and cash-flow checks expose

responsibility risk and focus Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA)/ DCMA field-pricing support requested by the
KO [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
3.3.2 Practitioner Steps

1. Baseline the offeror’s proposal: confirm certified cost or pricing data requirements, request data other than certified cost or
pricing data when warranted, and map contractual requirement traces [FAR].
2. Execute price analysis first—compare competition results, historical buys, catalog/commercial data, and independent
estimates; pivot to cost analysis when price analysis alone cannot demonstrate reasonableness [FAR].
3. Decompose direct labor, material, and Other Direct Costs (ODCs); verify indirect pools and allocation bases; and apply the
five allowability tests before accepting proposed cost elements [FAR].
4. Establish the profit/fee objective using the agency’s structured approach and update forward pricing rates or agreements as
necessary to avoid stale factors in negotiations [FAR].
5. Pull in field-pricing support early: blend DCAA audit results, DCMA production assessments, and program team technical
evaluations into the prenegotiation briefing and contract file [FAR] [FAR] [DFARS].
3.3.3 Proposed Price, Cost, Profit, and Fee
Proposed price. The offeror’s total price equals estimated cost plus any profit or fee applicable to the contract type [FAR].
Cost. Sum of allowable direct and indirect costs required to deliver the contract—all subject to reasonableness, allocability, and

cost-principle limits [FAR].
Profit. Negotiated incentive element above allowable cost for fixed-price or incentive contracts, set through structured analy-

sis [FAR].
Fee. Fixed remuneration on cost-reimbursement vehicles that does not vary with actual cost (e.g., CPFF fee) [FAR].

3.3.4 Direct and Indirect Cost Structure
Direct cost pools. Direct labor, materials, and ODCs traceable to a single final cost objective; charged through

project-specific accounts backed by bills of material, timecards, travel authorizations, or subcontract
quotes [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].

3.3 Cost and Price Evaluation

46

Indirect cost pools. Overhead (manufacturing, engineering) and General and Administrative (G&A) accrued across multiple

objectives, then allocated using consistent bases that reflect benefits received [FAR].
Proposed Price = Cost + Profit (or Fee)

3.3.5 Other Direct Costs and Cost Allowability
Other direct costs ( ODCs). Travel, subcontract services, specialized tooling, and similar charges that can be singled out for the

contract even though they are not labor or bulk material categories [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
Cost allowability. A cost is billable only if it is reasonable, allocable, consistent with applicable Cost Accounting Standards

(CAS)/ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), compliant with contract terms, and within any Subpart 31.2
limitations [FAR].
Note

Slides may refer to “cash allowability”; FAR terminology is cost allowability.

3.3.6 Cost and Price Analysis
Price analysis. Examination of the total proposed price without breaking out cost elements using competition, historical buys,

or market indicators [FAR].
Cost analysis. Evaluation of individual cost elements (direct, indirect, and profit) when price analysis alone cannot demon-

strate reasonableness [FAR].

3.3 Cost and Price Evaluation

47

Integrated view. Technical analysis, field-pricing support, and risk assessments feed both techniques to substantiate the final

fair and reasonable determination [FAR].
3.3.7 Forward Pricing Rates and Fully Burdened Labor
Forward Pricing Rate Proposal (FPRP). Contractor-submitted forward pricing rate proposal that lays out projected indirect rates

and factors for the pricing period [FAR].
Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA). Negotiated agreement-often executed by DCMA-that locks indirect rates for one to

three years, reducing repetitive audits and speeding negotiations [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
Fully burdened rate. Applies direct labor, indirect burdens, and any negotiated profit/fee to a common labor-hour baseline so

skill mixes can be compared on an apples-to-apples basis [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
3.3.8 Indirect Rate Math and Profitability Checks

Apply the standard relationships from the cost principles and the coursebook when validating proposals; they are board favorites
for quick-turn computations covering indirect pools, total cost input ( Total Cost Input (TCI)), G&A, and profitability metrics
such as ROS and ROA [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].

Track ROS and ROA against industry benchmarks, cash-on-hand, and debt loads to detect responsibility concerns or unsustainable buy-ins before negotiations [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
3.3.9 Oversight and Field Pricing Support
DCMA production insight. Delegated contract administration offices deliver manufacturing surveillance, schedule risk analysis,

and forward-pricing coordination; DFARS highlights that payment authority stays with the buying command even when
DCMA supports rates [DFARS] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].
DCAA audit coverage. DCAA is the responsible Government audit agency for most contractors, providing proposal adequacy

reviews, incurred cost audits, and financial capability analyses [FAR].
Integrated negotiation record. Document how DCMA, DCAA, technical, and program inputs influenced the prenegotiation

objective and the final price reasonableness determination [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

48

3.3.10 Checklist

• File both price and cost analysis results (including technical inputs) showing how the fair-and-reasonable price was determined [FAR].

• Verify each significant cost element passes the five allowability tests and that allocation bases match current practice [FAR].
• Confirm the current FPRA/ FPRP is in the file or document why legacy rates remain valid [FAR].
• Capture DCAA audit opinions, DCMA rate guidance, and profitability ratio trends in the prenegotiation briefing to evidence
responsibility diligence [FAR] [edo-3-2-4-cost-price-evaluation-2024].

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)
Refs:

3.4.1 What EVM is

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a project management technique that integrates scope, schedule, and cost to assess project
performance and progress. It provides a quantitative measure of project performance by comparing the planned work with the
actual work completed and the associated costs. EVM is widely used in government and defense projects to ensure that projects
are delivered on time and within budget.
3.4.2 Key Components of EVM

Core cost and schedule metrics establish the earned value performance baseline [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025,
edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025].
Planned Value (PV) / Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) : The budgeted cost for the work scheduled to be completed by

a specific date.
Earned Value (EV) / Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP) : The budgeted cost for the work actually completed by a specific

date.
Actual Cost (AC) / Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP) : The actual cost incurred for the work completed by a specific date.
Budget at Completion (BAC) : The total budget allocated for the project.
Estimate at Completion (EAC) : The forecasted total cost of the project based on current performance.
Cost Performance Index (CPI) : A measure of cost efficiency, calculated as CPI = EV/AC. A CPI less than 1 indicates a cost

overrun.

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

49

Schedule Performance Index (SPI) : A measure of schedule efficiency, calculated as SPI = EV/PV. An SPI less than 1 indicates a

schedule delay.
Schedule Variance (SV) : The difference between the earned value and the planned value, calculated as SV = EV − PV. A

negative SV indicates a schedule delay.
Cost Variance (CV) : The difference between the earned value and the actual cost, calculated as CV = EV − AC. A negative CV

indicates a cost overrun.
Info

The first three are equivalent terms and should know both. This guide will use the first set ( PV, EV, AC)

3.4.3 When to Use EVM

EVM is mandated on cost or incentive contracts (and applicable subcontracts) when the program meets the policy thresholds
and the effort is discretely measurable [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025, DFARS]. Key decision points for the PM include:
$100 million and above: Implement the full ANSI/EIA-748 standard and ensure the contractorâ€™s system is formally vali-

dated by DCMA.
$20 million to $99.9 million: Implement ANSI/EIA-748 guidelines, with validation required when performance indicates risk.

Additional policy considerations [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025, DoDI5000-85]:

• Applicability determinations must confirm the work scope can be discretely measured before mandating EVM.
• The Milestone Decision Authority may approve EVM on FFP, time-and-materials, or LOE contracts, but such use is discouraged absent clear benefit.

• For efforts below $20 million, the PM conducts a risk-based cost-benefit analysis to decide whether EVM adds value.
• Contracts that require EVM must also deliver Integrated Program Manager’s Data Analysis Report (IPMDAR) data and
complete an IBR within six months of award.
3.4.4 EVM Compliance

EVM clauses are flowed in the solicitation and award package (DFARS 252.234-7001 and 252.234-7002) alongside the Contractor Business Systems clause (DFARS 252.242-7005) to anchor validation and surveillance requirements [DFARS]. Compliance
expectations [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025, DoDI5000-85]:

• The program office integrates EVM planning into the WBS, maintains the Performance Measurement Baseline, and ensures timely receipt and analysis of IPMDAR submissions.

• DCMA leads EVM system acceptance, validation, and ongoing surveillance against ANSI/EIA-748 and the DoD EVM
Implementation Guide; DCAA supports with accounting system audits.

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

50

• Service focal points such as Acquisition Data and Analytics and the DON Center for EVM adjudicate applicability determinations and coordinate policy updates.

• Supervisor of Shipbuilding (SUPSHIP) can execute validation and surveillance responsibilities for shipbuilding programs on
behalf of DCMA.
3.4.5 EVM Compliance

EVM clauses are flowed in the solicitation and award package (DFARS 252.234-7001 and 252.234-7002) alongside the Contractor Business Systems clause (DFARS 252.242-7005) to anchor validation and surveillance requirements [DFARS]. Compliance
expectations [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025, DoDI5000-85]:

• The program office integrates EVM planning into the WBS, maintains the Performance Measurement Baseline, and ensures timely receipt and analysis of IPMDAR submissions.

• DCMA leads EVM system acceptance, validation, and ongoing surveillance against ANSI/EIA-748 and the DoD EVM
Implementation Guide; DCAA supports with accounting system audits.

• Service focal points such as Acquisition Data and Analytics and the DON Center for EVM adjudicate applicability determinations and coordinate policy updates.

• SUPSHIP can execute validation and surveillance responsibilities for shipbuilding programs on behalf of DCMA.
3.4.6 EVM Principal Players

Programmatic, contracting, and oversight roles synchronize to sustain disciplined performance management [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025].
PMO: Implements EVM on the contract, ensures solicitations and awards contain the required clauses, and works with the

contracting activity to tailor reporting and Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) requirements.
DCMA: Serves as the DoD EVM Executive Agent by validating, accepting, and surveilling contractor systems, maintaining the

official acceptance roster, and analyzing IPMDAR and schedule submissions (including the 14-point IMS review) to focus
government attention on emerging issues.
DCAA: Conducts accounting system audits, corroborates cost data, and supports DCMA during surveillance events and re-

views.
Acquisition Data and Analytics (ADA): Acts as the department-wide focal point for EVM policy, guidance, and competency man-

agement; issues interpretations to maintain consistent application across programs.
DON Center for EVM: Coordinates applicability determinations with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Acquisition

Policy and Budget and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and serves as the Navyâ€™s central point of contact for EVM
matters.

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

51

SUPSHIP: Performs many DCMA/ DCAA surveillance roles for shipbuilding contracts when delegated by the cognizant pro-

gram office.
3.4.7 PMB

Figure ?? shows the characteristic S-curve depicting cumulative PV/BCWS, while Figure ?? summarizes the progression from
defining the SOW to final Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) adjustments. PMBs are:

• Scoped, scheduled, and budgeted plans for the authorized work
• Time-phased budgets that align to the master schedule
• The basis for cost and schedule performance management
• Effectively the PV for the entire project

Figure 3.5. PMB Cost v.s. Time chart showing the “S”-curve. Source: edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025, edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025 [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025].

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

52

PMB Development

STEP 1: Define all work. Decompose the effort using the WBS and align it with the organizational structure. Control accounts are
the natural management points where Control Account Managers (CAMs) are assigned, and each control account contains
work packages and (if needed) planning packages.
STEP 2: Schedule the work. Develop the integrated schedule (often visualized with Gantt charts) that sequences the WBS elements,
includes key milestones, and forms the backbone of the time-phased budget.
STEP 3: Budget the work. Assign time-phased budgets to each work package, establish management reserve for in-scope known
unknowns, and confirm that the sum of the control accounts equals the contract budget base.
Changes to the PMB must be formally controlled and documented. Reasons for changes include:

• Contract changes
• Internal replanning
• Formal reprogramming
3.4.8 EVM Reviews and Reports

Formal reviews validate the integrity of EVM data products before and after system acceptance [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025].
Post-Acceptance Review

• Objective: ensure performance data remain accurate after system acceptance and identify any corrective actions required to
reaffirm compliance.

• Timing: conducted as needed following system acceptance and prior to the next IBR.
• Led by the Review Director (typically DCMA) with membership tailored to the purpose of the review.
• Culminates in a formal report prepared by the Review Director.
Initial Compliance Evaluation

• Objective: validate that the contractorâ€™s EVM system description matches actual practice and satisfies the EVMS criteria.

• Timing: executed prior to the initial IBR (and subsequently only if needed).
• Led by the DCMA Review Director with cross-functional support as required.
• Results documented in a report signed by the Review Director.

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

53

Integrated Baseline Review

• Participants: the contractor, PM and deputy, DCMA/ DCAA/ SUPSHIP personnel, and relevant technical staff.
• Purpose: joint assessment to verify the realism and accuracy of the PMB, confirm the entire technical scope is captured,
and ensure resources and schedules are achievable.

• Timing: conducted within six months of contract award (or major replanning event) in accordance with the DoD EVM
Implementation Guide and service policy [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025].
Integrated Program Management Data Analysis Report

This contractually required report delivers cost, schedule, and technical status derived from the contractorâ€™s EVM system,
enabling the PMO to identify performance problem areas and emerging risks. It is required on every contract that mandates
EVM and must be delivered at least monthly. The data set is tailored for each contract based on risk, size, and integration considerations, but the canonical formats are:
1. WBS (most common)
2. Organizational categories
3. Program Management Baseline
4. Staffing
5. Explanation and Problem Analysis
6. IMS
A Contract Funds Status Report (CSFR) complements the IPMDAR by providing funding (price) information that reconciles to
the cost-focused earned value data [edo-3-6-1-evm-intro-2025].
Problems

When using EVM, the following are indications that a problem exists [edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025]:

• Use of management reserves
• Significant revisions to the PMB
• Zero variance
• Sudden change in trends
• Unreasonable Total Cost Performance Index (TCPI)

3.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)

3.4.9 EVM Data Analysis

Figure ?? shows the S-curve representation of the EVM variables; the gaps between the curves are the cost and schedule
variances that drive performance assessments [edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025].

Figure 3.7. EVM chart showing the independent variables and variances. Source: edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025, edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025 [edo-3-6-2-e

Data Analysis Steps

1. Get current status: capture the latest cost and schedule performance using CPI, SPI, and narrative explanations.
2. Identify trends: analyze indices and variance trajectories over time to highlight emerging risks and opportunities.
3. Predict completion: develop independent EAC and Variance at Complete (VAC) assessments to forecast final outcomes.
4. Determine management actions: decide where to apply resources, contract changes, or risk mitigations to recover performance [edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025].
Performance Measurement Techniques
Percent Complete: Applies to long-duration tasks lacking interim milestones; progress is reported as the earned value fraction

of total budget.
Weighted Milestones: Uses milestone weights for long-duration tasks with clear waypoints, crediting earned value as milestones

are completed.
Percent Start/Percent Finish: Suitable for short-duration tasks (less than two reporting periods) with credit apportioned at start

and finish.
0/100 Method: Provides earned value only when the task is complete, offering a conservative measure for discrete, short

tasks [edo-3-6-2-evm-analysis-2025].

refreshes acquisition authorities and reporting duties—know the latest delegation trail before advising a
board [edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
Policy = DoD 5000 series. DoDD 5000.01 establishes acquisition principles and senior roles; DoDI 5000.02 operationalizes

the Adaptive Acquisition Framework (AAF) pathways; DoDI 5000.85 prescribes MCA execution details [DoDD5000-01,
DoDI5000-02, DoDI5000-85].
Regulation stack. FAR > Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) > Navy Marine Corps Acquisition

Regulation Supplement (NMCARS) translates statute and policy into enforceable contracting rules; SECNAVINST 5000.2G
tailors the acaaf for acdon programs and makes ASN(RD&A) the SAE [FAR, DFARS, SECNAV5000-2G].
The main drivers that a PM must balance is cost, schedule, and performance as shown in Figure ??. The trade space for performance versus cost is shown in Figure ??, which shows the relation of performance and cost with the threshold and objective
requirements.

4.1.2 Practitioner Steps (Board Prep Focus)

1. Confirm statutory authority and delegation: identify the Defense Acquisition Executive (DAE) (USD(A&S)) or delegated
Milestone Decision Authority (MDA), the SAE ( ASN(RD&A)), and the resource sponsor accountable for the requirement [DoDD5000-01, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025, SECNAV5000-2G].
2. Select the correct AAF pathway (or hybrid) and align entry/exit criteria, statutory reports, and decision forums (MS A/B/C,
Materiel Development Decision (MDD), Business Case Analyses (BCAs), Congressional notices) [DoDI5000-02,
DoDI5000-85].

3. Map contracting rules to the pathway: FAR/ DFARS clauses, competition requirements, and Tailored Acquisition Strategy
approvals [FAR, DFARS, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
4. Crosswalk Navy overlays: SECNAVINST 5000.2G, SECNAVINST 5400.15D organization responsibilities, and PEO/ DRPM
charters for technical authority touchpoints [SECNAV5000-2G, SECNAV5400-15D].
5. Prepare decision documentation: update the Acquisition Strategy / Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) / Test and Evaluation
Master Plan (TEMP), ensure statutory certifications (Clinger-Cohen, PPBE affordability caps) are current, and pre-brief the
chain (Program Office → PEO → ASN(RD&A)) [DoDI5000-85, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].

4.1 Acquisition Policy

58

4.1.3 Policy Stack and Authorities
Title 10, U.S.C. Establishes Service responsibilities (Subtitle C for DON organization, Subtitle A Part V for

acquisition management) and empowers annual NDAAs to adjust acquisition thresholds or pilot authorities [edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
DoD Directives/Instructions. DoDD 5000.01 sets acquisition principles, governance forums, and senior leader responsibili-

ties; DoDI 5000.02 implements the AAF with six scalable pathways; DoDI 5000.85 gives MCA-specific statutory requirements ( Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), cost reporting, baseline control) [DoDD5000-01, DoDI5000-02,
DoDI5000-85].
Regulations. FAR and DFARS governs all federal contracting; DFARS adds DoD-specific clauses (e.g., earned value, data

rights, cybersecurity); NMCARS adds DON policy and ASN(RD&A) approval levels [FAR, DFARS, NMCARS].
Service overlays. SECNAVINST 5000.2G tailors milestone documentation, Naval SYSCOM oversight, and Naval

Accelerated Acquisition; SECNAVINST 5400.15D assigns PEO and SYSCOM responsibilities for acquisition program
execution [SECNAV5000-2G, SECNAV5400-15D].
Advisory guidance. The Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) captures best practices—it is not directive authority, but boards

expect you to know how it informs planning reviews and tailoring memoranda [DoDAcqGuidebook].
Info

Boards expect you to quote the controlling document and state who owns the decision. Memorize the policy ladder:
Statute → Directive → Instruction → Regulation → Service overlay.

4.1.4 Acquisition Players and Decision Forums
DAE. USD(A&S) chairs the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), is MDA for ACAT ID/IAM programs unless delegated, and

approves key acquisition policies [DoDD5000-01, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
SAE. ASN(RD&A) serves as the DON SAE; appoints PEOs, assigns MDA for ACAT II and below, and ensures Navy acquisition

compliance with DoD policy [SECNAV5000-2G, SECNAV5400-15D].
Chief of Naval Operations/Resource Sponsor. Validates requirements and PPBE resourcing, provides integrated warfare/com-

munity priorities to ASN(RD&A) and the PEOs [edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
PEO/DRPM. Executes programs within delegated authorities; maintains acquisition baseline control, briefs ASN(RD&A) and

DAB-level forums, and ensures SYSCOM technical authority integration [SECNAV5400-15D, DoDI5000-85].
PM. Accountable for cost, schedule, performance; leads the IPT, maintains statutory certifications, and readies milestone

documentation [DoDI5000-85, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].

4.1 Acquisition Policy

59

Governance forums. Milestone Decision Reviews, the DAB, Configuration Steering Boards, Overarching IPTs, and Navy

Program Executive Council reviews provide structured oversight and risk adjudication [DoDD5000-01, DoDI5000-85,
edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
Note

Edge case: Rapid acquisition authorities (e.g., UCA) compress governance. Ensure delegation letters document any waived
statutory certifications before you recommend skipping a DAB or ASN(RD&A) review [DoDI5000-02].

4.1.5 Adaptive Acquisition Framework Pathways

The AAF can be visualized in Figure ??. The figure shows all six pathways with their purposes and general flow of the acquisition for each.

Figure 4.3. Adaptive Acquisition Pathways. Source: DAU-AAF, DAU-AAF [DAU-AAF].

The MCA is the main acquisition pathway that EDOs will operate in. As shown in Figure ??, it can be broken down into five
phases, four major decision points and three milestones.

Figure 4.4. Major Capability Acquisition with phases, milestones, and decisions points. Source: edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025, edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-pl

Major Capability Acquisition. Default for weapon systems; milestone-driven with statutory reports ( SAR, DAES) and Live-Fire/

TEMP requirements [DoDI5000-85].
Middle Tier of Acquisition. Rapid prototyping (≤5 years to field) and rapid fielding pathways; report to USD(R&E)/USD(A&S)

and Congress semi-annually [DoDI5000-02].
Software Acquisition. Iterative DevSecOps delivery, tailored documentation (Software Acquisition Strategy) and continuous

Authority to Operate emphasis [DoDI5000-02].
Business Systems. Focuses on business process re-engineering, investment review board certification, and Clinger-Cohen Act

compliance [DoDI5000-02].
Defense Urgent Capability. Immediate warfighter needs; compressed oversight but still documents affordability and sustain-

ment plans [DoDI5000-02].
Services Acquisition. Managed via DoDI 5000.74 (referenced in DoDI 5000.02) with governance through functional

domain leads; consider when an availability or modernization effort is better treated as a service [DoDI5000-02,
edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].
Info

Pathways can be combined (e.g., prototype under Middle-Tier then transition to MCA). Boards ask why your chosen path
best fits cost/schedule urgency.

4.1.6 Navy Overlays and Touchpoints
SECNAVINST 5000.2G. Implements ASN(RD&A) Program Decision Meetings, requires risk-based tailoring plans, and codifies

DON-level documentation (Acquisition Plan, Life-Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP), POA&M) [SECNAV5000-2G].
SECNAVINST 5400.15D. Aligns PEOs and SYSCOMs, clarifies technical authority (NAVSEA 05, NAVWAR 5.0) integration, and

designates Deputy ASN(RD&A) portfolio responsibilities [SECNAV5400-15D].
Resource Sponsor coordination. OPNAV N9, N4, or equivalent sponsor must endorse requirements and PPBE positions before

ASN(RD&A) decisions [edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025].

4.2 Milestones and Phases

61

Note

When SECNAV policy conflicts with older DoD memoranda, defer to the most current directive from the higher authority
unless ASN(RD&A) grants written tailoring. Document the rationale in the Acquisition Strategy.

4.2 Milestones and Phases

4.2.1 Defense Acquisition System Overview

The Defense Acquisition System (DAS) is the governance framework that aligns requirements, resourcing, and acquisition
execution to deliver warfighter capability. It is policy-driven by DoDD 5000.01 and process-enabled through DoDI 5000.02, using
the AAF to tailor pathways while preserving statutory oversight and Navy-unique controls [DoDD5000-01, DoDI5000-02].
4.2.2 Adaptive Acquisition Framework Pathways (Board Snapshot)
MCA. Default for complex weapon systems; uses phased milestones with mandatory statutory certifications; emphasizes afford-

ability trades, test rigor, and Navy two-pass / seven-gate touchpoints [DoDI5000-85].
Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA). Rapid prototyping or rapid fielding to deliver an operational capability within five years; mini-

mizes documentation, but demands robust transition planning to MCA or sustainment funding [DoDI5000-80].
Urgent Capability Acquisition (UCA). Accelerated path to field urgent capability within 2 years or provide an interim

solution in less than 5; leverages tailored test, streamlined acquisition decision memoranda, and dedicated senior
oversight [DoDI5000-81].
Software Acquisition Pathway. Iterative, DevSecOps-focused delivery of software increments with continuous integration, enter-

prise cloud alignment, and recurring user feedback cadences [DoDI5000-87].
Acquisition of Services Pathway. Structures service requirements, performance metrics, and contracting strategies to assure

mission outcomes and oversight thresholds (e.g., Multi-Functional IPT requirements review)[DoDI5000-74].
Defense Business Systems Pathway. Rationalizes business processes, data standards, and Business Capability Acquisitions Com-

mittees (BCAC) to unlock enterprise interoperability before investing in solutions [DoDI5000-75].
Note

Pathways are not exclusive—an EDO may begin in MTA for prototyping, then transition to MCA for production once
requirements and sustainment plans stabilize. Programs can also leverage UCA for an initial bridge while planning a
transition to MCA.

4.2 Milestones and Phases

62

4.2.3 Urgent Operational Needs Taxonomy
Joint Urgent Operational Need (JUON). Joint urgent gap requiring Combatant Commander sponsorship; validated by the Joint

Rapid Acquisition Cell with rapid fielding oversight [CJCSI3470-01H].
Joint Emergent Operational Need (JEON). Joint emergent gap tied to potential contingency; enables deliberate analysis but re-

tains joint prioritization and Board-level visibility [CJCSI5123-01H].
Urgent Operational Need (UON). Service-specific urgent need (e.g., Fleet Commanders); informs Navy resource prioritization

and can transition to JUON/ JEON if joint impact grows [OPNAVINST5000-42E].
4.2.4 Baseline Discipline: Acquisition Program Baselines, Deviations, and Nunn–McCurdy
APB. The cost-schedule-performance contract between the MDA, resource sponsor, and PEO; defines objective and threshold

values that bound trade space [DoDI5000-85].
Program Deviations. Triggered when performance, schedule, or cost thresholds breach; the Program Manager must notify the

MDA within 30 days and submit a corrective action plan within 60 [DoDI5000-85].
Nunn–McCurdy Act. Statutory reporting when Program Acquisition Unit Cost (PAUC) or Average Procurement Unit Cost (APUC)

breaches significant (≥15% current / 30% original) or critical (≥25% current / 50% original) thresholds; critical breaches
require certification to Congress within 60 days or program termination [USC-4371-NunnMcCurdy].
4.2.5 JCIDS Flow into the Defense Acquisition System
ICD. Supports the MDD with validated capability needs and initial attributes [CJCSI5123-01H].
CDD. Provides Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs) to anchor Milestone B and the Techni-

cal Requirements Baseline [CJCSI5123-01H].
Capability Production Document (CPD). Updates KPP/ KSA values for production decisions and sustainment planning at Mile-

stone C [CJCSI5123-01H].
Note

Maintain requirements traceability matrices linking KPP thresholds to test plans and APB values for board discussions.

4.2.6 Acquisition Strategy Essentials
Purpose. Documents tailored acquisition approach, contract strategy, intellectual property posture, and affordability con-

straints for MDA approval [DoDI5000-85].
Key Contents. Pathway selection, phasing plan, incentive structure, test and evaluation strategy, risk burn-down, sustain-

ment concept, cybersecurity, international cooperation, and business case for software/data management [DoDI5000-85,
DoDD5000-01].

4.2 Milestones and Phases

63

Approval Event. MDA concurrence at Milestone A (initial) with updates prior to Milestone B and significant re-baselines; Navy

2-pass/7-gate integrates resource validation before signature [OPNAVINST5000-42E].
4.2.7 International Acquisition Objectives
Foreign Military Sales (FMS). Strengthen partner capability while leveraging U.S. economies of scale; requires disclosure review

and Letter of Offer and Acceptance alignment [DoDI5000-85].
Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). Contractor-led exports; Program Office ensures configuration control and technology-security

compliance [DoDI5000-85].
Cooperative Development. Shared investment with allies (e.g., Memoranda of Understanding) to reduce life-cycle cost and

enhance interoperability [DoDI5000-85].
Armaments Cooperation / International Programs Security. Integrates disclosure, export licensing, and technology protection

plans into the Acquisition Strategy [DoDI5000-85].
4.2.8 Navy Two-Pass / Seven-Gate Review
Pass 1 – Capability. Led by OPNAV N9 to mature the requirement: Gate 1 validates the capability gap, Gate 2 refines solutions

and mission analysis, Gate 3 assesses affordability and alignment with Navy enterprises, and Gate 4 authorizes program
initiation (supports MDD)[OPNAVINST5000-42E].
Pass 2 – Resourcing. Led by OPNAV N8 to align budgeting: Gate 5 verifies contracting/test readiness before Milestone B (often

synchronized with the Development RFP Release Decision), Gate 6 confirms production and sustainment resources prior to
Milestone C, and Gate 7 evaluates sustainment performance and modernization plans [OPNAVINST5000-42E].
Note

For board prep, highlight where SECNAV Gate Reviews or Defense Acquisition Board touchpoints overlay Navy gates to
demonstrate cross-tier synchronization.
