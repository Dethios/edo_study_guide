# EDO Acquisition Tutor — Export Brief

**TL;DR**

- Default mode is **Board Prep**: concise, decision-focused, with Mermaid flows and a Decision Trace.
- **Primary-source verification with dates** is mandatory for any changeable fact (FAR/DFARS/DoDI/SECNAV/OPNAV, FMR, GAO).
- A single visible file defines standards: the **Instruction Pack** (baseline coursebook current as of **2025-09-12**).
- Study Guide production is active (LaTeX build/tooling threads); content gaps identified for **PPBE/fiscal law**, **NWCF v.s.\\ mission-funded**, **reprogramming**, and **definitions (AOR/NOR/SLR/IGT)**.
- Next steps: populate Fast Cues & Common Board Pivots, compile NAVWAR PMW list with citations, and finalize glossary process.

## What's in scope v.s.\\ missing

**In Scope (seen)**

- Project custom instructions (role, pedagogy, outputs, QA, recency, safety).
- File: `navy_edo_acquisition_tutor_instruction_pack_v_0.md`.
- Past chats (summarized) on Study Guide production (LaTeX/tooling) and acquisition topics (PPBE boards, PMW inventory, Fast Cues).

**Missing / Not directly accessible**

- Full, authoritative lists (e.g., current **NAVWAR PMW** offices with links).
- Specific section-level citations to FAR/DFARS/DoDI/SECNAV/OPNAV for identified gaps.
- The compiled **EDO_Qual_Study_Guide.tex** (final form) and any figures/tables beyond snippets.
- A canonical acronym/glossary file.

**Checklist for you**

- [ ] Provide current NAVWAR PMW roster with official URLs.
- [ ] Confirm controlling SECNAV/OPNAV/NAVSEA overlay instructions to track.
- [ ] Supply any command-preferred acronyms/definitions (AOR/NOR/SLR/IGT).
- [ ] Share recent NDAA-driven threshold changes you want emphasized.
- [ ] Decide glossary format (CSV/TeX/Markdown) for consistent ingestion.

## Project instructions (clean synopsis + critiques)

**Synopsis.** Tutor teaches Navy/DoD acquisition to EDOs with a **layered** template: brief → steps → **Mermaid** flow → checklist → Navy overlays → fiscal/PPBE with **SCN/WPN** nuance → **Decision Trace** → citations → assumptions → self-score. **Board Prep** is default; **Mastery** on request. Always verify recency; cite controlling sources with dates. Respect OPSEC/CUI; no legal advice.

**Critiques.**

- Excellent governance and QA; aligns with board prep needs.
- Add a tie-break rule when service-level guidance conflicts with OSD or older memos.
- Include a living list of specific overlay instructions (SECNAV/OPNAV/NAVSEA) and where to check for updates.
- Define a glossary pipeline (IDs, chunk sizes, update cadence).

## Decisions & rationale (with dates/citations)

- **Adopt Board Prep default** with Mermaid + Decision Trace (establishes consistent, board-aligned outputs). *Rationale:* Improves recall and decision reasoning for boards. *(Source: Instruction Pack; baseline 2025-09-12.)*
- **Mandate primary-source, dated citations** for thresholds/definitions (reduces drift and misstatement risk). *(Instruction Pack; 2025-09-12.)*
- **Stamp “Current as of [DATE]”** on all deliverables; re-verify FAR/DFARS/DoDI/SECNAV updates. *(Instruction Pack; 2025-09-12.)*
- **Build glossary and Fast Cues sections** to target board pivots. *(Chats: 2025-09-17, 2025-09-29.)*

## Risks, assumptions, and open questions

**Risks**

- Policy drift (NDAA/FAR/DFARS/DoDI) invalidates prior outputs.
- Overfitting Navy overlays may underemphasize joint contexts.
- PMW/echelon org changes outpace documentation.

**Assumptions**

- Access to public, official sources is available during drafting.
- Coursebook baseline (2025-09-12) remains valid until superseded.

**Open Questions**

- Which specific overlay instructions (SECNAV/OPNAV/NAVSEA) are controlling today?
- What update cadence should we enforce for PMW lists (e.g., quarterly)?
- Any command-specific “must-cover” board pivots beyond the current Coverage Map?

- **You (Tutor):** Draft **Fast Cues & Common Board Pivots** with Mermaid flows & citations — **by 2025-10-19**.
- **Me:** Confirm overlay instruction list & priority — **2025-10-15**.
- **You (Tutor):** Author modules for **AOR/NOR**, **SLR**, **IGT**, **NWCF v.s.\\ Mission-Funded**, **Reprogramming**, **Commitment/Obligation/Expenditure/Outlay flow** — **by 2025-10-26**.
- **Me:** Approve glossary format and provide initial acronyms — **2025-10-18**.
