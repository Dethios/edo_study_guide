\subsection{Project Overmatch and Digital Modernization}
\begin{description}[style=nextline,labelsep=0.5em,font=\bfseries]
  \item[\textbf{Five Eyes Project Arrangement.}] On 21~Feb~2025 the Project Overmatch team signed a formal Project Arrangement with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, enabling Cooperative Project Personnel to embed in San Diego and co-develop networked kill chain tools for Distributed Maritime Operations.\autocite{DVIDS-Overmatch-FVEY-2025}
  \item[\textbf{Open DAGIR pilot.}] By 18~Jun~2025 Project Overmatch, NAVWAR, the Chief Digital and AI Office, and DIU were onboarding commercial AI/ML applications through the Open DAGIR pipeline so Fleet commanders could visualize readiness data (``Maven Smart Systems'') across the hybrid fleet in weeks instead of years.\autocite{DVIDS-Overmatch-OpenDAGIR-2025}
  \item[\textbf{Leadership signal.}] VADM Seiko Okano continues to serve as the direct reporting program manager for Overmatch even as she moves into the PMILDEP billet, ensuring the digital architecture remains tied to Program Decision Meetings and portfolio trades.\autocite{DVIDS-Overmatch-OpenDAGIR-2025,SECNAV5000-2G}
\end{description}

\subsection{EDO Community Updates}
\begin{description}[style=nextline,labelsep=0.5em,font=\bfseries]
  \item[\textbf{NAVWAR change of command.}] Rear Adm.\ (now VADM) Seiko Okano relieved Rear Adm.\ Doug Small on 9~Aug~2024, assuming command of NAVWAR and direct oversight of Project Overmatch; she emphasized information warfare dominance and continued alliance engagement with industry and academia.\autocite{DVIDS-Okano-2024}
  \item[\textbf{Role of the PMILDEP.}] As PMILDEP to \ac{asnrdanda}, Okano now chairs Program Decision Meetings when delegated and synchronizes \acp{pae} and SYSCOM technical authority, a critical linkage as Capability Trade Councils and portfolio scorecards begin replacing JCIDS artifacts.\autocite{SECNAV5000-2G,secwar-acq-transformation-2025}
  \item[\textbf{Tycom maintenance focus.}] USFF and PACFLT maintenance flag officers continue to drive execution of regional maintenance center reforms and the Naval Sustainment System--Shipyards initiatives highlighted in the 2025 coursebook; these billets remain key board discussion topics because they link EDO leadership to depot performance.\autocite{edo-3-3-1-acq-policy-players-2025}
\end{description}

\subsection{Acquisition Policy and Industrial Base Highlights}
\begin{description}[style=nextline,labelsep=0.5em,font=\bfseries]
  \item[\textbf{Warfighting Acquisition System (WAS).}] The Acquisition Transformation Strategy replaces JCIDS with Capability Portfolio Management and Capability Trade Councils, empowering \acp{pae} to adjudicate cost/schedule/performance trades in real time and document decisions in portfolio scorecards.\autocite{secwar-acq-transformation-2025}
  \item[\textbf{Industrial base actions.}] SECWAR directed the Department to expand multi-year procurements, establish an Industrial Base Consortium, and reform bid protest incentives so the Munitions Acceleration Council and similar bodies can stabilize demand and attract private capital.\autocite{secwar-acq-transformation-2025}
  \item[\textbf{PPBE integration.}] USD(C) and USD(A\&S) are piloting portfolio budgets and flexible execution authorities so \acp{pae} can move funds inside approved controls while maintaining transparency with OMB and Congress---a major shift boards will expect candidates to explain.\autocite{secwar-acq-transformation-2025}
