\subsection{BA, commitment, obligation, expenditure, outlay}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{BA} available (legal authority).
  \item \emph{Commitment} (administrative reservation).
  \item \emph{Obligation} (legal liability via contract/order).
  \item \emph{Expenditure} (payment recorded).
  \item \emph{Outlay} (cash disbursed/Treasury).
  \item[] Source references~\autocite{DoDFMR-Vol3,Treasury-GInvoicing}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Appropriation categories, scope, obligation windows}
\Tab{\ref{tab:appropriation_categories}} shows the Colors of Money with their spending categories and obligation windows.  Figure~\ref{fig:ppbe_approps_lifecycle} from \S~\ref{sec:colors_of_money} visually shows when each category is Current, Expired, or Cancelled.

\subsection{Funding policies}
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Annual. (\ac{omn}/\ac{milpers}).}] Fund only bona fide needs of the fiscal year.
  \item[\textbf{Incremental. (\ac{rdte}).}] Fund work as it occurs by fiscal year.
  \item[\textbf{Full-funding. (Procurement/\ac{milcon}).}] Fund the total usable end-item at award.\footnote{Exceptions to Full funding are select \ac{scn} programs (CVNs, SSBNs, and LHD/LHAs) with Congressional approval.}
\end{description}

\emph{Common techniques/exceptions:} Advance Procurement (long-lead items), Multiyear Procurement, Economic Order Quantity, Cost-to-Complete when provided in law.

\subsubsection{Exceptions to the Full Funding Policy}
\label{sec:full-funding-exceptions}
Below is the list of the key exceptions to the Full Funding Policy, what they allow, and the must-know rules/approvals (Table~\ref{tab:full_funding_exceptions} shows full details).

    Advance Procurement (incl. LLTM/EOQ) & APN, OPN, SCN              & Limited \emph{early} funding (often 1--2 years before the main ``buy'' year) for long-lead components or EOQ lots to protect schedule or achieve price breaks. & Narrow and part-specific; must be justified in budget docs; EOQ commonly tied to MYP (or explicit block authority); does \emph{not} equal full funding of the end item.      \\

\subsection{Navy Sustainment Funding: TYCOM v.s. Fleet (O\&S)}
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Who holds O\&M,N.}] Type Commanders (\emph{TYCOMs}; e.g., COMNAVSURFOR, COMNAVAIRFOR, COMSUBFOR) are the primary executors of \ac{omn} for unit readiness: flying hours, steaming days, intermediate-level maintenance, training, and afloat/ashore support.
  \item[\textbf{Fleet Commanders.}] PACFLT and USFF set operational priorities and readiness goals, adjudicate contingencies, and may centrally manage certain Fleet-wide initiatives; they influence TYCOM allocations but most execution occurs at the TYCOM.
  \item[\textbf{Program Office (SYSCOM/PEO).}] Funds in-service engineering, tech data, Diminishing Manufacturing Sources, and modernization using \ac{opn}/\ac{apn} (end items/kits) and \ac{rdte}/\ac{omn} (installation, trials) as appropriate; manages sustainment \acp{idiq}/PBL with color-of-money compliance.
  \item[\textbf{Who pays what.}] \ac{opn}/\ac{apn}: hardware/software upgrade kits, initial spares; \ac{omn}: installs, fleet introduction/training, minor mods, repair parts consumption; \ac{rdte}: development/test of engineering changes. NAVSUP/NWCF activities recover costs via rates for supply/repair.
  \item[\textbf{Board cue.}] In O\&S, TYCOMs execute most \ac{omn}; Program Managers fund modernization and in-service support from \ac{opn}/\ac{apn}/\ac{rdte}. Align funding lines with the \ac{wbs} and the Colors-of-Money rules to avoid Anti-Deficiency Act risk.
\end{description}

% Optional quick bullets (kept minimal and consistent with your style)
Quick information regarding exceptions to the full funding policy:
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{\ac{myp}.}] Up to 5 years; stable design; verifiable savings; cancellation liability planned.
  \item[\textbf{Advance Procurement (\ac{lltm}/{\ac{eoq}}).}] Focused early buys for schedule/savings; not full funding.
  \item[\textbf{\ac{bb}.}] Congressionally authorized multi-ship buys; obligate by \ac{fy}; not the \ac{myp} statute.
  \item[\textbf{\ac{ctc}.}] Complete original scope when estimates mature upward; separate \ac{scn} request.
  \item[\textbf{\ac{rcoh}.}] Planned mid-life overhaul; incremental \ac{scn} with advance procurement of cores/critical material.
\end{description}

\subsection{Which money when (by acquisition phase)}
Table~\ref{tab:msa_phase_approp} shows the nominal types of appropriation used for \ac{msa}, \ac{tmrr}, \ac{emd}, \ac{pd.phase}, and \ac{os.phase}

\begin{center}\begin{talltblr}[
    caption = {Appropriation types per phase},
    entry   = {Appropriations per Phase},
    label   = {tab:msa_phase_approp},
  ]
  {
    colspec = {F L},
    stretch = 1.2 % (Optional) avoid row Ã¢â‚¬Å“stretchingÃ¢â‚¬Â; see notes below
  }
  \toprule
  {Phase} & {Typical appropriation(s)}\\
  \midrule
  MSA     & RDT\&E (analyses, prototyping); small OMN for studies\\
  TMRR    & RDT\&E (risk reduction, development, test)\\
  EMD     & RDT\&E (develop/build/test/qualify); selected long-lead/AP/EOQ in Procurement when authorized\\
  PD      & Procurement (e.g., OPN); limited RDT\&E for fixes\\
  OS      & OMN sustainment; spares via Procurement as applicable\\
  \bottomrule
\end{talltblr}\end{center}

\subsection{MILCON v.s.\ O\&M sustainment v.s.\ OPN modernization}
\emph{Rule of thumb:} Real property construction $\Rightarrow$ \ac{milcon}; keeping systems running (repair/overhaul, services) $\Rightarrow$ \ac{omn}; new capability/end-item upgrades $\Rightarrow$ Procurement (e.g., \ac{opn}).

\subsection{Field Activity Financial Management (NWCF quick hits)}
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Goal.}] \ac{nwcf} activities price to \emph{break even over time}; in-year result is \textbf{\ac{nor}}, cumulative is \textbf{\ac{aor}}.
  \item[\textbf{Rates (\ac{slr}).}] Recover direct labor + overhead + G\&A; shocks flow to NOR/AOR and are managed over time.
  \item[\textbf{Carryover.}] Unfilled orders at \ac{fy} end; subject to limits/management.
  \item[\textbf{\ac{igt} via G-Invoicing.}] Treasury-mandated platform for intra-gov orders/settlement; apportionment/availability rules still govern customer funds.
