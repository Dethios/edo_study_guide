# Editing/Writing Style

- Ensure it is consistent with rest of the document
- Ensure that all acronyms are within `acronyms.def`, all acronyms with be used with an `\ac{}` call
  except for headings, tables, section titles, subsection titles, subsubsetction titles, paragraph
  titles, or anything that will show up in the TOC
- `\autocite` will be used for normal citations and inline citations. It will follow normal IEEE
  formatting guidance (e.g., can be used as a noun, must be within the punctuations of a sentence
  when used inline.)
- `\srcCite` will be used for tables, figures citatins that empasses the entire passage where an
  inline citation would not make sense.
- Information will be verified via source references (include those referred to by the coursebook).
  Another verification against DAU and other online DoD Acquisition Guidedances will be needed.
- New references will be added to `edo.bib`
- The information will need to make logical sense with the rest of the study guide. This includes,
  but is not limited to:
  - Adding references to other parts of the study guide
  - Adding information into other parts of the study guide
  - Remove/relocating information from other parts of the study guide
- `longtblr` will be the default table format used unless there is a reason otherwise
- Figures will use `[H]` placement.
- Analyze the entire document to verify acronyms usage and citations are consistent across the
  entire document.
- Analyze the entire document to verify formatting and style is consistent across the entire
  document.
- Ensure that `acronyms.def` is sorted into logical groups first then alphabetically within each
  group
- Unless other overridden by other guidance, please ensure that the requirements from the IEEE
  Author Guide's and Editor's Guide for formatting and styling are applied.
