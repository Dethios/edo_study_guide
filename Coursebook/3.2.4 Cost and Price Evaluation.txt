Determining Contract Price
 Contracting Officer (KO) is responsible for evaluating the reasonableness
of offered price
– KO uses their training, experience, good business judgment, and different
types of analyses to determine if an offer is fair and reasonable
– Price analysis, cost analysis, technical analysis, field pricing support, and risk
analysis may be used for this determination

 Cost analysis and price analysis are the primary techniques used in
determining if the proposed contract price is fair and reasonable

Fair and reasonable price determined via any combination of price, cost, technical, field
pricing support, and risk analyses

Proposed Price

* Direct Cost: Any cost that is identified with a particular final cost objective
** Indirect Cost: Any cost not identified with a single final objective, but
identified with two or more final cost objectives
3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

Cost Analysis
 The review and evaluation of separate cost elements and profit in an
offeror's or Contractor's proposal
 The application of judgment to determine how well proposed costs
represent what the cost of the contract should be, assuming reasonable
economy and efficiency
 All elements of cost are examined, such as materials, labor, indirect costs,
and profit (fee)
 FAR 15.404‐1(c) contains techniques and procedures for performing cost
analysis
 Cost analysis is more time‐consuming than price analysis, and might
increase the contract price

Price Analysis
 “The process of examining and evaluating a proposed price without
evaluating its separate cost elements and proposed profit." (FAR 15.404‐
1(b))
 Price analysis techniques include:
– Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation
– Comparison of prior proposed prices with current proposed prices for same or
similar terms
– Application of rough yardsticks (e.g., $/ton)

An evaluation of price relative to prices in the marketplace paid by the general public
for the same or similar items

Cost or Pricing Data
 Required when the contract action amount exceeds $2M
– Cost or pricing data shall not be obtained if the KO concludes that one of the
five exceptions listed in the "Prohibition on obtaining cost or pricing data"
applies (FAR section 15.403‐1)

 Cost or pricing data must be specifically requested by the Government in
the solicitation
 When cost or pricing data are required, the KO should generally request a
technical analysis of proposals by the appropriate technical personnel
– Technical Analysis is an evaluation of the type and quantities of material,
labor, and other technical aspects of the proposals

Cost vs. Price Analysis
 Cost Analysis

 Price Analysis

– Looks at detailed cost
breakout
– Reasonableness is based on
thorough analysis of each
cost element
• Direct Labor
• Indirect Rates (Fringe,
Overhead and G&A)
• Material
• Subcontracts
• Other Direct Cost

– Looks at total price
– Reasonableness is based on a
comparison of proposed
prices to same or similar
items
– Profit is embedded in price

– Profit is evaluated

Field Pricing Support
 Field pricing support consists of all audit and other specialist effort
necessary for the KO to determine the reasonableness of the proposed
cost or price
 The KO should consider requesting field pricing assistance for:
– Accountants
– Auditors
– Price/cost analysts
– Negotiators
– Engineers
– Small and disadvantaged business utilization specialists (SADBUS)
– Production Specialists

 Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) field assistance
 Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit assistance for fixed price
proposal exceeding $10M and cost‐type proposals exceeding $100M

Overview
 Contractor financial health

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

13

Contractor Financial Health
 Part of determining if an offeror is responsible is determining their
financial health. There are two primary profitability ratios that can help
with this:
– Return on Sales (ROS)
– Return on Assets (ROA)

 To understand and calculate ROS and ROA, it is necessary to understand
two annual reports:
– Balance Sheet
– Income Statement

 Debt, cash on hand, and cash flow analyses also help to determine
financial health
Determining an offeror’s financial principles and health is a key to determining if they
are responsible and therefore eligible to be awarded the contract

Balance Sheet
 Represents the financial condition of an organization as of a specific date

3

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

15

Income Statement
 Summarizes sales revenue and expenses for a period of time

3

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

16

Analyzing Profitability
 Return on Sales (ROS) (a.k.a. profit margin) is a ratio that measures how
efficiently a company generated profits from its revenue
 Measure of profitability
 Calculated by dividing net income for the period by sales (revenue)

Increasing ROS indicates the company is growing more efficient, while a decreasing ROS
could signal looming financial troubles
3

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

17

Analyzing Profitability
 Return on Assets (ROA) looks at the ability of a company to utilize its
assets to gain a net profit
 It is a measure of efficiency
 Calculated by dividing net income for the period by the total value of the
assets on the balance sheet:

The higher the ROA, the more a company earns on a smaller investment
3

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

18

Analyzing Profitability
 To understand if a company’s ROA is acceptable, you need to compare it to
other companies within the same industry
 When a firm has an ROS or ROA that is more than one or two percent
points less than the historical averages for the industry, you should find
out why
 DCMA administers most DoD contracts and usually has insights into a
firm's financial health
– Some of the variation in ratios between firms may be explained by unusual
accounting events during a given year (i.e., merger costs)

Profitability is a motivator and a constraint for a Contractor to
participate in Defense acquisition

Direct and Indirect Costs
 Direct Costs

 Indirect Costs

– Direct costs are those costs that
can be tracked to one specific
cost objective
– Includes direct materials, direct
labor, and other costs traceable
direct to that single cost
objective
– Clearly identified
– Easily identified with final
product

– Indirect costs applies to two or
more cost objectives
– Includes costs associated with
•
•
•
•
•

– Typically, indirect costs are
placed into two categories:

“Cost objective ” means a function,
organizational subdivision, contract, or other
work unit that has direct costs for which cost
data are desired

Indirect Costs
 Overhead

 General & Administrative (G&A)

– The category of indirect costs
that support a specific part or
function of the company but
not the entire company
• Supports multiple cost
objectives
• Allocated across the cost
objectives it supports

– The category of indirect costs
that support the whole
company
• Allocated across all the
product lines

– Examples include:

– Examples include:
• Supervision
• Engineering
• Production Control
• Quality control
• Material handling

Indirect Cost Examples

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

24

Cost Allowability
 Allowable cost are most of the cost incurred as direct or indirect
– If costs are allowable, they are billable

 While the total cost of the contract includes all costs properly allocable to
the contract, the allowable costs to the government are limited
 There are five bases for cost allowability:
1. Reasonableness
2. Allocability
3. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP)
4. Contract Terms
5. Limitations set forth in FAR 31.205

 Unallowable costs cannot be passed on to the Government as defined by
Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 31

6

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

25

Cost Allowability (cont)
 Allocability: A cost is allocable if it is incurred specifically for the contract
or benefits the contract and other work (i.e., it's an overhead cost), and
can be fairly distributed based on benefits received, or it is necessary for
overall operation of the business (i.e., certain G&A expenses)
 Unallowable Cost:
– Bad debts
– Contributions or donations
– Entertainment cost
– Costs of alcoholic beverages

Indirect Cost Rates
 Indirect cost rates:
– The way to make sure that the total cost of whatever we build includes its fair
share of all the costs associated with running the company
– Overhead and G&A cost rates determine how much to include in the total cost
of a contract item
– Usually expressed as a percentage

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

28

Indirect Cost Rates
 Allocation Base:
– Represents the method of allocation. It can include direct labor dollars, direct
labor hours, material dollars, total machine hours, or total units produced

5a

3.2.4 Cost and Price Evaluation

29

Indirect Cost Pools
 Indirect cost pools:
– Represents indirect costs to be allocated
– A collection of different indirect costs that are combined into a single
“pool” to simplify their allocation
– The costs in each pool should be homogenous ‐ similar in purpose
– Allocated to a cost objective based on a logical (causal beneficial)
relationship to the direct costs in the pool
– Cost pool examples:
• Material handling
• Design support
• Heat and air conditioning
• Building maintenance
• Manufacturing support

= $1.33 on Mfg overhead
This means that $1.33 of manufacturing overhead is
allocated to (is “fair shared to”) every $1.00 of direct
manufacturing labor for every product

TCI = $50k + $100k = $150,000
G&A = $15,000
G&A rate = G&A Costs = $15k = 0.10 or 10%
TCI
$150k
In this case, $0.10 of General & Administrative cost will be allocated to each
product for every $1.00 of all other (direct and indirect) costs

G&A rate is useful for comparing companies cost performance

Fully Burdened Rate
 Used by an offeror to ensure direct labor, indirect costs, and profit are
accounted for in their pricing
 Useful data point for comparison by analyzing total cost to the
Contractor on a time basis
 Another use of fully burdened rate is in cost estimation. Instead of looking
at only the bottom‐line cost, we can analyze estimated costs at the trade
level; for example:
– Add up engineer days and then multiply by the fully burdened engineer rate
– Add up machinist days and then multiply by the fully burdened machinist rate

Practical Exercise: Fully Burdened Rate
 Contractor XYZ reported the following for Contract A22
– 50,000 hours direct labor (DL)
– $1 million DL costs
– $0.50 million manufacturing overhead
– $0.20 million other costs

 Calculate the Fully Burdened Rate for this Contractor for Contract A22
 Fully Burdened Rate = (Direct + Indirect Cost) / Time
= ($1M + $0.50M + $0.20) / 50,000 DL hrs
= $34/hr

38

Forward Pricing Rates
 Purpose

 Process

– An agreement between the
Contractor and Government in which
certain indirect rates are established
for a specified period (typically, one to
three years)
• These rates are estimates of costs
and are used to price contracts
and contract modifications
– To ensure that contract prices are fair
and reasonable which can speed up
the contracting process by eliminating
the need to audit or analyze the rates
– DCMA negotiated FPRAs avoid each
KO doing their own rate analysis in
their overall cost analysis
– Provide reasonable projections to
estimate and budget for the costs of
contracts
7

– Contractor submits a Forward Pricing
Rate Proposal (FPRP) to the
Government for the certification of
their cost and labor rates over
specified period
– Government performs review of
Contractor proposal to establish well‐
supported negotiation positions
– Contractor and Government
negotiate and agree on rates which
lead to a Forward Pricing Rate
Agreement (FPRA)
– ACO monitors the Contractor's rates

Summary
 Why is it important to determine the financial health of an offeror?
– Financial health is a key input in determining if an offeror is responsible

 What are the two profitability ratios that can be determined from the
balance sheet and income statement?
– Return on Sales (ROS) and Return on Assets (ROA)

 What is the difference between a direct cost and an indirect cost?
– Direct costs are those costs that can be identified to a specific category of cost
under the requirement, such as labor or material
– Indirect costs do not apply to one specific cost object (i.e., power bill for a
building, facility security)

 What is the fully burdened rate?
– The fully burdened rate includes all costs to the Contractor (direct costs +
indirect costs)
